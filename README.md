## Mountainbike Trail Finder

Although I am a newbee when it comes to mountain biking, it becomes one of my greatest passions in no time. For that reason, as my graduation project of Spiced Academy, I decided to built a website that helps others to find the location of the different mountain biking trails on a map, in Berlin.

After users are logged in, they can find the different trails on a map, give the trails a like, and leave a comment about their experiences on that trail.

According to number of the likes a trail received, most rated top three trails are going to be determined for users review.

Users can also check the weather condition to see that if it is a great day for a ride. OpenWeatherMap's API is used for that purpose.

Last but not least, users can communicate with each other and invite other users for a ride with the chat function that is built with Socket.IO.
